# Hand Gesture Recognition
In this project I have proposed a Hand Gesture Recognition system that can be used to operate the Kiosk Machine in a touch-less way. Self-service kiosk machines have gained a lot of popularity and they are used at many public places like a restaurant, movie theatres, malls, etc. A hand gesture recognition system can be used to prevent the physical contact between the users and the kiosk machine considering the effects Covid-19 pandemic had on the world.
<p> The following block diagram shows the different components involved in the system :-</p>
